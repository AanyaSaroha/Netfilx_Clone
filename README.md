# Netfilx_clone_by_html_css by Aanya Saroha

Welcome to my Netflix clone project! This project is a simple attempt to replicate the basic layout and design of the Netflix user interface using HTML and CSS. Please note that this is a static clone and does not include advanced functionality like video playback or server-side operations.

Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the content of the web pages.

CSS: For styling and layout purposes.
